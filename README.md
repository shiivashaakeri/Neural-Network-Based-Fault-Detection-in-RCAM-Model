This project introduces a fault detection framework using neural networks for the RCAM. The study begins by remodeling the RCAMâ€™s nonlinear dynamics to simulate various fault conditions. Subsequently, data generated from these faulty models underpin the training and testing of neural networks.

## INTRODUCTION

This project introduces a fault detection framework using neural networks for the RCAM. The study begins by remodeling the RCAM's nonlinear dynamics to simulate various fault conditions. Subsequently, data generated from these faulty models underpin the training and testing of neural networks, which aim to classify and accurately identify system faults.
