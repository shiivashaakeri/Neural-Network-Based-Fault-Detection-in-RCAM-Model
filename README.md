# Neural-Network-Based-Fault-Detection-in-RCAM-Model
This project introduces a fault detection framework using neural networks for the RCAM. The study begins by remodeling the RCAMâ€™s nonlinear dynamics to simulate various fault conditions. Subsequently, data generated from these faulty models underpin the training and testing of neural networks.
